    QUESTION 1: Based on the Chi-squared statistic and the degrees of freedom, is there a significant relationship 
    between time spent in Hawaii and becoming infected with COVID-19 at a significance level (alpha) of 0.05?

    ANSWER: At a significance level of 0.05, the Chi-squared test suggests that a relationship (does/does not) exist
    between time spent in Hawaii and becoming infected with COVID-19.



    QUESTION 2: If a significance level (alpha) of 0.1 had been used, would our interpretation of the Chi-squared 
    statistic change? How so?
