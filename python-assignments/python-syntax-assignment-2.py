print("********  QUESTION 10  ********")
# While talking with her friends, Kate had a brilliant idea to get rich. In her
# Python programming class, where she learned to write code, she learned about
# data types, operators, and functions and figured that it wouldn't be too difficult
# to use that knowlege to build a computer program that could solve her friends' 
# homework assignments. She figured that if she could only get a laptop, she would 
# be able to write the code, sell her program, and get rich. Unfortunately, however,
# Kate only started with $20.00.

# Create a variable called `money`, and use the assignment operator to set it equal
# to the number `20.00`. Print out `money` to make sure it was created correctly.

# Your code here


print("********  QUESTION 11  ********")
# Kate decided to market her project to her friends as an investment opportunity.
# After guaranteeing each of them a lifetime supply of completed homework 
# assignments once the code was completed, she managed to raise $670.49 towards 
# buying herself a new laptop.

# Using the addition assignment operator, add to the `money` variable created
# previously the $670.49 that Kate collected. Print out `money`.

# Your code here


print("********  QUESTION 12  ********")
# After depositing all of her money at the bank, Kate logged onto her Amazon account
# and purchased a sleek looking laptop for $649.99.

# Using the subtraction assignment operator, subtract $649.99 from Kate's money. 
# Print out `money`.

# Your code here


print("********  QUESTION 13  ********")
# Kate toiled over her program for the next three months. Eventually, she finished
# and started selling cheap USB drives in an abandoned alley across the street from
# the school with her computer program on them. The program was a huge success, and
# Kate ended up selling 237 USB drives. She sold them for $8.00 each.

# Use the multiplication assignment operator to multiply the variable
# `usb_drive_money` by 237 to see how much money Kate made from her USB drive sales.
# Print `usb_drive_money`.

# Your code here


print("********  QUESTION 14  ********")
# Kate and her 14 friends decide that they would rather split all the money evenly 
# instead of getting free homework assignments for life. They want to split the 
# money left over after the laptop purchase (`money`) and the money from the USB 
# sales (`usb_drive_money`).

# Use the addition assignment operator to add `usb_drive_money` to the `money`
# variable. Then, use the division assignment operator to divide `money` by 15 and 
# print it out. You should be left with the variable `money` equal to 129.1.

# Your code here

print("********  QUESTION 15  ********")
# The total money was divided into 15 different parts (Kate and her 14 friends). If
# Kate keeps one part, how much money did she make from her coding project? Use the
# `money` variable and subtract Kate's initial $20.00 to see how much she made and
# then print it out.

# You should get the answer 109.1 ($109.10).
