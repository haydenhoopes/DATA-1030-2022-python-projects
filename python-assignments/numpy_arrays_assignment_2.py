# Use the following 1-dimensional NumPy array to answer the questions below:

number_matrix = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0])


# *********  QUESTION 1  *********
# Use indexing to get the number '8' out of the `number_matrix`. Print it out.

# Your code here


# *********  QUESTION 2  *********
# Use indexing and slicing to print out numbers 3 through 6 from the `number_matrix`.

# Your code here


# *********  QUESTION 3  *********
# Use indexing and slicing to print out the even numbers from the `number_matrix`.

# Your code here


# Use the following 2-dimensional NumPy array to answer the questions below:

letter_matrix = np.array([
    ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e'], 
    ['f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j'], 
    ['k', 'l', 'm', 'n', 'o'], 
    ['p', 'q', 'r', 's', 't'], 
    ['u', 'v', 'w', 'x', 'y']])

# *********  QUESTION 4  *********
# Use indexing to print the letter 'q' out of the `letter_matrix`.

# Your code here


# *********  QUESTION 5  *********
# Use indexing and slicing to print out the entire second-to-last row of the `letter_matrix`.

# Your code here


# *********  QUESTION 6  *********
# Use indexing and slicing to print out the entire second and fourth columns of the `letter_matrix`. This should
# return a new matrix (ie. 2-dimensional array).

# Your code here


# *********  QUESTION 7  *********
# Use indexing to print out all of the vowels in the `letter_matrix`. You can use multiple print statements.

# Your code here


# *********  QUESTION 8  *********
# Using indexing, modify `matrix_1` to look like the following matrix. Print it out when you are done.
# [  0  0  1 ]
# [  0  9  1 ]
# [  0  0  1 ]

matrix_1 = np.zeros((3, 3))

# Your code here


# *********  QUESTION 9  *********
# Using indexing, modify `matrix_2` to look like the following matrix. Print it out when you are done.
# [  0  0  0  7  0]
# [  1  1  1  1  1]
# [  3  4  5  4  3]
# [  1  1  1  1  1]
# [  7  0  0  0  0]

matrix_2 = np.zeros((5, 5))

# Your code here
   

# *********  QUESTION 10  *********
# Using indexing, modify `matrix_3` to look like the following matrix. Print it out when you are done.
# [  1  0  3  0  3  0  0]
# [  0  1  0  2  2  2  0]
# [  4  4  1  4  4  4  4]
# [  0  0  0  1  0  0  0]
# [  9  9  9  0  1  0  0]
# [  9  9  9  0 10  1  0]
# [  9  9  9  0  0  0  1]

matrix_3 = np.zeros((7, 7))
