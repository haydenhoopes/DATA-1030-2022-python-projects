# ********  QUESTION 2  ********
# Make two functions: circumferenceOfCircle() and areaOfCircle().
# Each function returns and prints the circumference of a circle given a 
# radius. You can use the variable PI as an approximation of pi.
# Below each function definition, call the function using a made up value
# to show that it works.

# Your code here


# ********  QUESTION 3  ********
# Make a function called typeOfVariable() that accepts a parameter called 
# variable. This function should print but not return variable and its type 
# to the console. Below the function definition, you can create a variable 
# (using a name other than 'variable') and then call the function, or simply 
# enter the variable itself into the typeOfVariable() function to show that 
# it works.

# Your code here
def typeOfVariable(variable):
    print("The variable is " + str(variable) + " and its type is " + str(type(variable)))
