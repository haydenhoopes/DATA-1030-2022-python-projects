# 2. Using the following list of numbers:
#   a. Use the len() and sum() functions to compute the mean of the set of numbers.

#      the nth value in the list where n is len() // 2 (integer division).
#   c. Print out the mean and median. (The mean is 21, the median is 7)

numbers = [5,5,8,2,9,1,100,34,2,6,7,7,7,3,1,6,60,76,7,2,9,85,3,8,5,23,0,3,69,35,50,3,3,86,1,1,45]
