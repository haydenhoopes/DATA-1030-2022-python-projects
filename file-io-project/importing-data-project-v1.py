# Transpose Table Function Assignment

# Name: 
# BTECH #: 

# INSTRUCTIONS
# Create a function that takes in a regular csv file as a parameter and transposes it (ie. flip it on its side)
# This means that rows will become columns, and columns will become rows.
# The function will read the old file in and save a new file, with the name indicated in the function parameters
# Make sure to add the parameter encoding='utf-8-sig' to the open() function!

import csv

def transpose_csv(path, new_file_name):
    # Your code here
        
    return

# This function will take in the Apple Unit Sales data and output the same, transposed (flipped) data as a new CSV.
transpose_csv("apple_unit_sales_data.csv", "transposed_file.csv")
